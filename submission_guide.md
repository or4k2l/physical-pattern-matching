## My Recommendation: Start with Workshops

### Why?

1. Fast feedback (3-4 months vs 12+ for journals)
2. Community building (meet researchers at workshops)
3. Iterative improvement (use feedback to improve for conference)
4. Lower risk (higher acceptance rates)

### Suggested Path:

```
Workshop (NeurIPS HAET)
    -> (accepted + feedback)
Conference (IJCNN)
    -> (accepted + more data)
Journal (IEEE TNNLS)
```

## Tips for Acceptance

### What Reviewers Will Love:

1. Reproducible code (you have this)
2. Clear motivation (safety-critical systems)
3. Novel metric (confidence margins vs just accuracy)
4. Ablation study (shows you understand the mechanism)
5. Honest limitations (builds trust)

### What Reviewers Might Question:

1. Simplicity of task (binary classification)
   - Response: "This is a proof-of-concept; future work extends to multi-class"

2. Single dataset
   - Response: "KITTI is standard benchmark; we've added Cityscapes in revision"

3. Simulation vs hardware
   - Response: "Ideal memristor model; hardware validation is ongoing"

4. Comparison with SOTA
   - Response: "CNN baseline is intentionally simple; we focus on physical vs digital, not SOTA beating"

### How to Address in Paper:

Add a paragraph in Discussion:

> "While our current evaluation focuses on binary classification with 64x64 images, the principles extend naturally to multi-class problems and higher resolutions. Future work will validate these findings on Cityscapes (multi-class segmentation) and with fabricated memristor devices. Our simple CNN baseline is intentional--we seek to understand the effect of physical constraints in isolation, rather than claiming superiority over highly-optimized architectures."

## Sample Cover Letter

When submitting to journals or some conferences, you'll need a cover letter:

```
Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript titled "High-Confidence Pattern
Recognition via Physically-Constrained Computing: Memristive Crossbar
Arrays for Safety-Critical Systems" for consideration in [VENUE NAME].

This work addresses a critical gap in robust machine learning: while
most research focuses on accuracy, safety-critical applications require
high confidence in predictions. We demonstrate that physical constraints
in memristive crossbar arrays provide implicit regularization, achieving
158x higher confidence margins than standard neural networks on the KITTI
autonomous driving benchmark.

Key contributions include:
1. First systematic robustness study on real-world driving data (700 tests)
2. Ablation analysis revealing the mechanism of implicit regularization
3. Open-source reproducible implementation

This work is original and has not been submitted elsewhere. All code
and data are publicly available at:
https://github.com/or4k2l/physical-pattern-matching

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Yahya Akbay
```
