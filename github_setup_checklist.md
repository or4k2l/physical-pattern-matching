# GitHub Setup Checklist

Follow these steps to publish your repository.

## 1. Create GitHub Repository

### Via GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `physical-pattern-matching`
3. Description: "High-Confidence Pattern Recognition via Memristive Crossbars"
4. Public (for visibility)
5. Initialize with README: no (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Via GitHub CLI (if you have it)
```bash
gh repo create physical-pattern-matching --public --description "High-Confidence Pattern Recognition via Memristive Crossbars"
```

---

## 2. Upload Your Code

### From Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Physically-Inspired Pattern Matching v1.0"

# Add remote (replace 'or4k2l' with your username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/or4k2l/physical-pattern-matching.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### From GitHub Desktop
1. File -> Add Local Repository
2. Choose your project folder
3. Commit all files
4. Publish repository

---

## 3. Add Your Visualization Images

Create an `assets/` folder and add your PNG images:

```bash
mkdir assets
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/comprehensive_comparison.png assets/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/ablation_analysis.png assets/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/theoretical_analysis.png assets/

git add assets/
git commit -m "Add result visualizations"
git push
```

Important: The README.md references these images at:
- `assets/comprehensive_comparison.png`
- `assets/ablation_analysis.png`
- `assets/theoretical_analysis.png`

---

## 4. Enable GitHub Features

### a) Enable Issues
1. Go to your repo -> Settings -> General
2. Scroll to "Features"
3. Check "Issues"

### b) Enable Discussions (Optional)
1. Same settings page
2. Check "Discussions"
3. Great for Q&A

### c) Add Topics
1. Go to your repo main page
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics:
   - `neuromorphic-computing`
   - `machine-learning`
   - `autonomous-driving`
   - `hardware-ml`
   - `kitti-dataset`
   - `memristive-crossbar`
   - `jax`

---

## 5. Make It Discoverable

### Add a Description
In the same "About" section, add:

High-Confidence Pattern Recognition via Memristive Crossbars.
Achieves 158x higher robustness margins than CNNs for safety-critical systems.

### Add a Website (Optional)
If you create a GitHub Pages site, add the URL here.

---

## 6. Create Your First Release

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Initial benchmark with KITTI"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to "Releases"
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Choose tag `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `v1.0.0 - Initial Release`
5. Description: Paste key results
6. Click "Publish release"

---

## 7. Social Media Promotion

### Tweet Template
```
New open-source research: Physically-Inspired Pattern Matching

## 8. Monitor and Respond

- Check "Watch" on your own repo for notifications
- Respond to issues within 48 hours
- Star interesting related repos
- Network with neuromorphic computing researchers

---

## 9. Optional: Add a Colab Notebook

Create `notebook.ipynb` for easy experimentation:

```python
# At the top of the notebook
!git clone https://github.com/or4k2l/physical-pattern-matching.git
%cd physical-pattern-matching
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then run
!python physically_inspired_pattern_matching.py
```

---

## 10. Maintain and Update

### When you make changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: description of changes"
git push
```

### For major updates
```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0: Added CNN baseline"
git push origin v1.1.0
```
